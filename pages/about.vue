    Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Cameron Benson
</p>

<p>
    Currently I work as a Web developer for X Enterprises and I also run a small side buisness which is what you see on this website! 
</p>


<p>
    Ive been 3D printing since about halfway into 2024. My girlfriend bought me my first 3D printer (a standard ender 3) while I was sick.
    Ever since, Im always looking for excuses to print random things to solve every day problems. 
    Its mostly a hobby for me, but I figured that some of the things I design could be useful for other people- Which led me to making the decision to sell a commercial license to all of my models for other people to sell them!
</p>

<p> My interest in all things related to tech and engineering started in 6th grade engineering class. We had a teacher named Mr.Stoddard and he made everything so much fun and he taught us how to 3d model, 3d print, use wood working tools, basic information about how circuts work- and so many other random things that made school so much fun.

    Im a huge fan of all things related to technology and machines. I've always been interested in learning how thing work & I've always had the "I can fix it" mentality.
    learning how to fix things and make them better is one of my favorite things to do.
