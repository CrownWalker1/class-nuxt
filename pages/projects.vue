            <p><img class="size-55 pt-2" src="\ezgif.com.crop (2).gif" alt=""></p>
            <p class="mt-2">This is similar to an every day fidget spinner you would see at the store. However this one is made to perfectly fit the average size finger tip & be child safe! There are no sharp edges on this design, I even made the inner gear portions angled in such a way that you cant really get your fingers crimped in them.</p>

            <p class="mt-2">This is my most popular design. It's two pieces that pass through eachother seamlessly and provide a really fun illusion.</p>

            <p><img class="pt-2" src="\ezgif.com.crop (4).gif" alt=""></p>
            <p class="mt-2">This is an earlier iteration of my fidget toy, however I still really like this one. It is also a helix toy, where the two peices pass through eachother seamlessly. However this one is much smaller than all of my other toys, so its easier to keep it on your desk.</p>

            <p class="mt-2">This project was extremely fun for me. Im still newish to making puzzles, but im proud of how this one turned out. Its as descibed, a pyramid that I turned into a puzzles. It's not meant to be a hard puzzle, It is meant to serve as both a puzzle and a show piece for your desk.  </p>
